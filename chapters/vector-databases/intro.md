# Introduction to Vector Databases

A **vector database** stores and indexes **high-dimensional numeric vectors** — usually **embeddings** of text, images, audio, or any other content an ML model can encode — and lets you query them by **similarity** rather than by exact match. They are the storage layer behind semantic search, recommendation systems, and the retrieval step of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that powers most modern LLM applications.

## Why a new kind of database

Ask a relational database *"find customers whose name is 'Ada'"* — easy. Ask it *"find documents that are semantically similar to this paragraph"* — impossible without help. The paragraph doesn't have exact matches; it has *concepts*. Vector databases solve exactly this: they store a vector per item, and given a query vector they return the most similar items fast.

## Embeddings in one paragraph

An **embedding model** maps content into a fixed-length numeric vector (e.g., 384, 768, 1536, or 3072 dimensions) such that semantically similar content lands close together in the vector space. Text embeddings typically come from models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`, Google's `gemini-embedding`, or open-source models on Hugging Face. Image, audio, and multimodal embeddings work the same way with different encoders.

The mechanics of how embeddings are produced (tokenization, contextual attention, training objectives) are outside the scope of this book; what matters here is that a trained encoder turns content into a point in a vector space, and items with similar meaning end up close together.

## Similarity metrics

A vector database answers *"which stored vectors are closest to this query vector?"* using a similarity or distance metric:

- **Cosine similarity** — angle between vectors; dominant metric for text embeddings
- **Dot product** — related to cosine when vectors are normalized; used by many OpenAI-style models
- **Euclidean (L2) distance** — straight-line distance; used for image embeddings and clustering
- **Manhattan (L1) distance** — sum of absolute differences; used occasionally

Make sure the metric you query with matches the metric the embedding model was trained for.

## Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indexes

Exact nearest-neighbor search over millions of 1536-dim vectors is slow. Vector databases use **approximate** indexes that trade a tiny amount of recall for orders-of-magnitude speedup:

- **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs) — most popular; great quality/speed trade-off
- **IVF** (Inverted File with product quantization) — partition the space into cells, search only the nearest cells; compresses vectors aggressively for low memory
- **ScaNN** — Google's state-of-the-art; used in Vertex AI Vector Search
- **FAISS** — the library Meta released that started the ANN revolution; used inside many products

You don't usually pick the index manually — but you *do* pick `ef_construction`, `ef_search`, `M`, or `nprobe` knobs that control the recall / latency trade-off.

## Filtering — the killer feature

Real applications need similarity search *within a subset* — *"documents similar to X that belong to tenant Y and were published after January 2025"*. This is called **metadata filtering** or **hybrid search**. Two strategies:

- **Pre-filter** — restrict to matching rows first, then run ANN. Correct but can be slow if the filter is narrow.
- **Post-filter** — run ANN over everything, then filter the top-k. Fast but can return too few results.
- **Filtered HNSW** — modern indexes (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) integrate filtering into the graph traversal.

## Hybrid search

For text, **dense retrieval** (embeddings) is great at semantics but can miss exact keywords. **Sparse retrieval** (BM25, TF-IDF) catches exact keyword matches. **Hybrid search** combines both scores and re-ranks — the standard approach in production RAG.

## The product landscape

- **Pinecone** — managed, fully hosted; the earliest mover
- **Chroma** — open-source; dead simple, great for prototypes
- **Weaviate** — open-source or managed; hybrid search, module ecosystem
- **Qdrant** — open-source or managed; Rust; excellent filtering
- **Milvus** — open-source; distributed; industrial scale
- **LanceDB** — open-source; embedded, works directly on object storage
- **pgvector** — extension that adds vector search to PostgreSQL — now the default for many teams because it keeps vectors alongside relational data
- **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** — added vector support; great for teams already running them
- **Vertex AI Vector Search**, **Azure AI Search**, **AWS OpenSearch** — cloud-native managed options

## A minimal Python example (Chroma)

```python
import chromadb

client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chroma_db")
col = client.get_or_create_collection(name="policies")

# Store documents (Chroma auto-embeds with its default model)
col.add(
    ids=["p1", "p2", "p3"],
    documents=[
        "Employees must submit expense reports within 30 days.",
        "Annual performance reviews occur in January and July.",
        "Office parking requires a valid permit renewed yearly.",
    ],
    metadatas=[{"category": "finance"}, {"category": "hr"}, {"category": "facilities"}],
)

# Semantic search with filter
results = col.query(
    query_texts=["how do I expense my travel costs?"],
    n_results=2,
    where={"category": "finance"},
)
print(results["documents"])
```

## Vector databases in the enterprise

This capability moves a vector database from "nice experiment" to load-bearing infrastructure:

- **Semantic search** over internal documents, product catalogs, customer tickets
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — ground LLM answers in private enterprise data
- **Recommendation** — find similar products, similar users, similar content
- **Anomaly / duplicate detection** — items whose embeddings cluster far from everything else
- **Clustering and topic discovery** — group unstructured content by meaning

All of these were prohibitively expensive a few years ago. Vector databases made them routine.

## Learning outcomes

- Explain what an embedding is and why similarity search is useful
- Choose an appropriate similarity metric for a given embedding model
- Describe how ANN indexes achieve sub-linear retrieval at cost of small recall loss
- Use metadata filters and hybrid search correctly
- Pick a vector DB product for a given scale / cost / ops profile
- Build a simple semantic-search pipeline end to end
